# FastAPI – Learning & Practice Repository
This directory is part of my main Python learning repository and contains hands-on exercises, experiments, and mini-projects related to FastAPI.

The purpose of this section is to document my learning journey with FastAPI, including practical implementations, common patterns, and real-world use cases while following tutorials, courses, and self-driven exploration.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains
Inside this FastAPI folder, you will find:

- Basic FastAPI applications and routing examples

- Working with path parameters and query parameters

- Async programming concepts (async / await)

- HTTP client usage (httpx, async requests)

- API consumption and data processing

- CLI-based async scripts

- Error handling and debugging practice

- Gradual transition toward real-world API design

Each folder or file represents a learning step or experiment, not a production-ready project.
## 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice FastAPI fundamentals

- Understand async Python in real scenarios

- Learn how APIs communicate with external services

- Build a strong foundation for backend development

- Track progress over time in a structured way

## 📂 Repository Structure
The structure may evolve over time as new topics are added.
Folders are generally organized by lesson, version, or topic, reflecting the order in which they were learned or practiced.

## 🔗 Main Repository
This directory is part of the main repository:

For a broader overview of all Python-related exercises, projects, and learning paths (including non-FastAPI content), please refer to the main repository.

## ⚠️ Notes

- This repository is intended for learning and practice purposes

- Code may be experimental or simplified

- Improvements and refactoring are ongoing

- Some files are intentionally kept minimal to focus on specific concepts

## 🚀 Progress
This section will continue to be updated as I:

- Learn more advanced FastAPI concepts

- Integrate databases and authentication

- Build more structured API projects
